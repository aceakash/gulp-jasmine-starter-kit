gulp-jasmine-starter-kit
========================

A starter-kit for general node modules with testing in Jasmine.

Gulp has `test` and `watch` tasks.

Run `npm install` and then `npm test` to run the tests.

Just `gulp` will start watching for changes to *.js files, and re-run tests when they change.
